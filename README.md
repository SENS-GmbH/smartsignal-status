# SENS - IoT Overview

This app provides customers with an overview and current status of their IoT devices by accessing the REST API of "IOTA". The app is built using Vanilla React JS with React-Router-Dom and interacts with the REST API of "IOTA". Each instance of "IOTA" has its own link, such as "/smartsignal" or "/sens" for the multitenant instance. The app can also provision new devices if this feature is enabled.

## Installation
